# Resume

PDF hosted on [resume.sujal.dev](https://resume.sujal.dev). I've also implemented lines between sections if you want to
use this as a template and you like lines, just change `\togglefalse{lines}` to `\toggletrue{lines}`.

## Credit

[This](http://ezyang.com/ezyang-resume.pdf) resume "inspired" me to create this one, the original one is absolutely
beautiful.
